# Creational Pattern Factory

- Allow instance objects in execution time with the same interface
- Is not actually a Design Pattern, is more of a programming idiom. But it is commonly used.

Note: in this project we use ts-node to execute typescript without compiling it previously.

## 1. Install the program

Execute:

```shell
npm i
```

## 2. Execute the program

```shell

```
