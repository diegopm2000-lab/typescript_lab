# Creational Pattern Singleton

- One single instance of a class
- Global use of this
- In high concurrency can appear problems in performance

Note: in this project we use ts-node to execute typescript without compiling it previously.

```url

```

## 1. Install the program

Execute:

npm i
```

## 2. Execute the program
